<h1> ENES100 Arduino Project </h1>

## üìù Overview üìù

The ENES100 OTV is an Arduino-powered robotic vehicle designed to perform multiple tasks autonomously, including:

-Navigating around obstacles.

-Detecting magnetic fields.

-Using a robotic claw to extract objects from a cylinder.

This project was developed as part of the ENES100 course to combine mechanical design, electronics, and programming into a fully functional robotic system.

## How we built it
Hardware:

Arduino Uno microcontroller for control logic.

Ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection.

Hall Sensor for magnetic field sensing.

Servo motors to control the robotic claw.

DC motors with motor drivers for vehicle movement.

Software:

Written in Arduino C/C++.

Integrated sensor data to make navigation decisions in real-time.

Control algorithms for precise claw operation and object retrieval.
